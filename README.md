# Automation Reporting Dashboard | Power BI + Microsoft Fabric
The transformation of a manual, Excel-based reporting process into a structured, automated pipeline using Microsoft Fabric and Power BI.

# Context
The Internal Audit team previously relied on a manual process to generate Commerical reports from ERP exports. Each week, 27 Excel files (in .xls format) are manually downloaded, compiled into 3 master files to refresh, and then refreshed in Power BI. This process was time-consuming (≈45 minutes), error-prone, and difficult to maintain.

**🔄 Before: Manual Workflow (Slow, Error-Prone)**
